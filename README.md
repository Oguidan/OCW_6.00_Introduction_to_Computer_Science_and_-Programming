# OCW_6.00_Introduction_to_Computer_Science_and_Programming

Welcome to the **OCW_6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming** repository! This repository provides all the materials and resources needed to follow along with MIT's OpenCourseWare (OCW) course "6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming."

## Course Overview

This course is intended for students with little to no programming experience. The focus is on introducing students to the fundamentals of computer science and programming using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, students will have developed a solid understanding of programming principles and computational thinking, which are essential for tackling more advanced topics in computer science.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Lectures**: Contains lecture notes, slides, and other materials that correspond to the course's video lectures.
- **Problem Sets**: Includes the problem sets and their solutions, designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures.
- **Code Examples**: Contains Python code examples used throughout the course.
- **Exams**: Includes past exams and solutions to help you assess your understanding of the course material.

## Getting Started

To get started with this course:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OCW_6.00_Introduction_to_Computer_Science_and_Programming.git
